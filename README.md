# Supplement Diary

###Information

* This app allows users to keep track of various supplements they've taken over time. The user can
write reviews/experiences about a particular supplement, note doseages, and rate their overall opinion of a particular supplement. It is often difficult to remember which supplements you've taken, whether or not they've worked for you, how they've effected your mood, what doseage you were taking etc... This app is an attempt to bring much needed organization to the supplement taking process. Supplement Diary could be useful for anyone taking a number of pills but is largely targeted for use by brain/body hacking communities such as those found at [BodyBuilding.com](http://www.bodybuilding.com/).com and [BulletProof Exec]( http://www.bulletproofexec.com).

* Source code [available on Gitbub](https://github.com/alexhawkins/supplement-diary)
